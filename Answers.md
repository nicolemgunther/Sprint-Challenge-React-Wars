1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React JS is an open-source JS library, used for handling the front end of single page applications. It allows us to create reusable components in the UI. The problems it solves are that it allows DOM updates to be quick and reflect in other parts of the UI if the same data is used. It also prevents the webpage from reloading whenever the DOM updates using the virtual DOM.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

To think in React means to think about how you will breka your project into small components in an effective manner.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Class components use state, which are mutable (changeable). They are ES6 classes that extend React.Component and 'react' to the condition of the virtual DOM. Functional components are functions that show data and pass through props, which are read-only or not mutable.

1.  Describe state.

As described above, state is a mutable condition that stores information for a component.

1.  Describe props.

Props is short for properties, and props allow us to pass data from parents to children in the code.
